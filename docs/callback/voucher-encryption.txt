# 🔐 Voucher Encryption & Decryption

The `voucher_code` field is **encrypted** before being sent in the payment callback payload.  
This ensures the voucher remains secure during transmission and can only be read by authorized systems.

## 🔒 Encryption Specification

| Item | Value |
|------|------|
| **Algorithm** | AES-256 |
| **Mode** | CBC |
| **Encryption Key** | SHA256(API Key) |
| **Output Format** | Base64 encoded string |
| **IV (Initialization Vector)** | Random, included in encrypted result |

## 🔁 Encryption & Decryption Flow

1. The system encrypts the voucher using the merchant **API Key**.  
2. The encrypted voucher is sent inside the callback payload.  
3. The merchant backend decrypts the voucher using the **same API Key**.

```
Original Voucher → Encrypt (API Key) → Encrypted Voucher → Callback Sent
→ Receive Callback → Decrypt (API Key) → Original Voucher
```


### voucher_code is encrypted and Base64 encoded.

```
⚠️ Important Security Notes
🔑 Keep your API Key confidential and secure.
🚫 Never decrypt voucher codes on frontend/client-side applications.
🛡 Always verify the callback signature before decrypting the voucher.
🔄 Encrypted values will differ each time due to random IV generation.
🧾 Decryption must be performed only on trusted backend systems.
